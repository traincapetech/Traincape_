                With 150+ IT and non-IT courses available, each course has its own unique fee structure and duration. The cost of a course can vary widely based on factors such as the complexity of the subject matter, the level of expertise it offers, the duration of the course (whether it's short-term or long-term), and the institution or platform offering the course.
                <br />
                For example, IT courses might include programming languages like Python, Java, or C++, cybersecurity training, data science and machine learning, web development, cloud computing, and more.
                <br />
                Non-IT courses could range from business management and finance to creative arts, languages, health sciences, and many others. To determine the cost of a specific course, it's essential to look at the details provided by the course provider.
                <br />
                This information typically includes the course syllabus, duration (in weeks or months), whether it's self-paced or instructor-led, any certifications offered upon completion, and of course, the fee structure. Some courses may offer installment plans or discounts for early registration, while others might include additional resources or support services in their pricing.
