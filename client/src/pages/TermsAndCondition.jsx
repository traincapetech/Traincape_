          including PMP, Azure, and many more. These courses are designed to
          ensure that working professionals can attend and complete them within
          their contexts and limitations in time. The courses are interactive
          and rich with activities, discussions, and field visits. Participants
          are issued Certificates of Participation given attendance,
          participation, and completion of assignments. <br /> <br /> Regarding
          our return policy, we offer a 7-day money-back guarantee. If you are
          not satisfied with the course, you can raise a refund request within 7
          days of purchase. However, please note that the money-back guarantee
          is void if you have accessed more than 25% of the course content or
          attended online classes for more than one day. Additionally, if you
          download the E-Book for the course, the money-back guarantee will be
          void. Any refund request beyond 7 days of purchasing the course will
          not be accepted and no refund will be provided. Refunds will be
          processed within 10 working days after the refund request is approved.

          The fastest way to ensure you get what you want is to return the
          course you have, and once the return is accepted, make a separate
          purchase for the new item.
